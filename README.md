# plugin-cognito

> [Architect](arc.codes) serverless framework plugin that defines Cognito User Pools and associated Lambdas triggers

This macro enables your [arc.codes](arc.codes) app to define a [Cognito User
Pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html), which is a user directory managed by AWS. AWS handles the complexity of storing user credentials, providing password reset flows, and even managing multi-factor authentication. It also provides [Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html), allowing certain events happening within your User Pool to trigger serverless function invocations.

## Installation

1. Run: `npm i @copper/plugin-cognito`

2. Then add the following line to the `@plugins` pragma in your Architect project manifest (usually `app.arc`):

        @plugins
        copper/plugin-cognito

3. Add a new `@cognito` pragma. This will generate a Cognito User Pool in your
   Architect app (and will name it after your app name). The following example
   defines two User Pool configuration properties:

        @cognito
        StandardAttributes email
        RecoveryOptions verified_email

    [The full list of available User Pool properties supported by this plugin are
    listed below](#customization).
4. (optional) If you've added any Lambda triggers to your User Pool definition, run `arc create` to generate your User Pool Lambda trigger functions (under
   `src/cognito`). You can customize each generated trigger Lambda's `index.js` file, just as you would any classic arc
   `@http`, `@events`, etc. function.

## Customization

This plugin allows for the customizaion of many, but not all, of the available
Cognito User Pool attributes and properties provided by the [CloudFormation
`AWS::Cognito::UserPool`
template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cognito-userpool.html). If you'd like to see support for further attributes, file an issue in this repo! Another alternative is that you can always drop in to the CloudFormation template with your own custom [arc macro](https://arc.codes/docs/en/guides/extend/custom-cloudformation) or [plugin](https://arc.codes/docs/en/guides/extend/plugins) to customize the functionality to your heart's desire!

|Property|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`<trigger>`|Defines Lambda triggers for your Cognito User Pool. The available trigger names are `CreateAuthChallenge`, `CustomMessage`, `DefineAuthChallenge`, `PostAuthentication`, `PostConfirmation`, `PreAuthentication`, `PreSignUp`, `PreTokenGeneration`, `UserMigration` and `VerifyAuthChallengeResponse`. To define multiple triggers, add one per line under your User Pool definition inside `app.arc`. Each trigger added to your `app.arc`, upon running `arc init`, will create a corresponding trigger Lambda folder under `src/cognito/`. Check out the [AWS documents on how to work with Cognito Lambda Triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) for more details.|<pre>CreateAuthChallenge<br>VerifyAuthChallengeResponse</pre>|
|`RecoveryOptions`|Defines what recovery options a user has if they forget their password. Available options are `admin_only` (admin will have to reset the user's password), `verified_email` (email-based recovery), and `verified_phone_number` (phone-based recovery). A maximum of two options may be specified, and order matters! The first options will be used first, then the second option will be used if that fails. If `admin_only` is specified, any other values will be ignored.|`RecoveryOptions verified_phone_number verified_email`|
|`AllowAdminCreateUserOnly`|You can choose to only allow administrators to create users or allow users to sign themselves up.|`AllowAdminCreateUserOnly true`|
|`AutoVerifiedAttributes`|Which attributes will Cognito verify during user signup? Available options are `email` and `phone_number`. You may specify either or both. If you don't want auto-verification of either, omit this option. Depending on the options you choose, you may be charged extra! Ensure you familiarize yourself with how this system works by reading [AWS' docs on the topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-email-phone-verification.html?icmpid=docs_cognito_console).|`AutoVerifiedAttributes email phone_number`|
|`SESARN`|The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a verified email address in Amazon SES. Cognito will use this address to send emails during signup and account recovery. Since the `app.arc` format reserves the use of the `@` character, make sure you quote the ARN string!|`SESARN "arn:aws:ses:us-west-2:123456789091:identity/support@myapp.com"`|
|`FromEmail`|Identifies either the sender's email address or the sender's name with their email address. For example, `testuser@example.com` or `Test User <testuser@example.com>`. This address appears before the body of the email. If you provide this option, you must also specify `SESARN` (see above). Since the `app.arc` format reserves the use of the `@` character, make sure you quote the value!|`FromEmail "MyAppSupport <support@myapp.com>"`|
|`StandardAttributes`|Cognito provides built-in attributes that it will track for each user. You can specify one or more of these using `StandardAttributes`. Available options are `address`, `birthdate`, `email`, `family_name`, `gender`, `given_name`, `locale`, `middle_name`, `name`, `nickname`, `phone_number`, `picture`, `preferred_username`, `profile`, `zone_info`, `updated_at` and `website`.|`StandardAttributes name phone_number`|
|`CustomAttribute:<name>`|You can also track your own custom attributes for each user. Each custom attribute is composed of a name, type, minimum value (or length, depending on type), maximum value (or length, depending on type) and whether it is mutable. The format for defining custom attributes is `CustomAttribute:<name> <type> <min> <max> <mutable>`. This plugin currently supports types of `String` or `Number`. If a type of `String` is provided, `<min>` and `<max>` define the minimum and maximum length of the string. If a type of `Number` is provided, `<min>` and `<max>` define the minimum and maximum value of the number. `<mutable>` is a boolean.|`CustomAttribute:FavouriteColour String 2 20 true`|
|`UsernameAttributes`|Determines whether email addresses or phone numbers can be specified as user names when a user signs up. Possible values are `phone_number` or `email`, and either or both can be provided.|`UsernameAttributes email`|
|`UsernameCaseSensitive`|Specifies whether username case sensitivity will be applied for all users in the user pool through Cognito APIs.|`UsernameCaseSensitive false`|

## Runtime Use

Once your arc application is deployed to AWS, you can interact with the Cognito
User Pool from inside your various Lambda functions by retrieving the User Pool
ID and Provider URL via the [`@architect/functions`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@architect/functions)
package (note: must be version 3.13.12-RC.1 or newer!). These variables can then
be used in conjunction with the AWS SDK to interact with the User Pool.

The following snippet demonstrates what this would look like in a typical arc
lambda function:

```
let arc = require('@architect/functions');

exports.handler = arc.http.async(async function http () {
    let services = await arc.services();
    console.log(services.copper['plugin-cognito']);
    /* prints out e.g.:
     * {
     *   "cognitoPoolId": "us-west-2_y1QH6IeAK",
     *   "cognitoPoolProviderURL": "https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/us-west-2_y1QH6IeAK"
     * }
     * ... rest of lambda function code ...
     */
});
```

For a live example, check out the included sample application, and specifically the
`src/http/get-index/index.js` file.

## Sample Application

There is a sample application located under `sample-app/`. `cd` into that
directory, `npm install` and you can directly deploy using `arc deploy`.
